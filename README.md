# Boat Lighting

This project controls a lighting system designed for a boat (in this case, a pontoon).  Note that, while the provided Python code in the `old` directory works, I am working on rewriting this as such that it works more smoothly.

## Hardware

The following hardware was used for this project:

* Raspberry Pi Zero W
* Relay Board
* NPN Transistors
* IP67 LED Strip Lighting
* Push button
